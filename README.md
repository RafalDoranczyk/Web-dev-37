WEBDEV CHALLENGE NR 37    

My very first fully made website based on project named 'webDevChallenge nr37".
I tried to make it ready for different devices with media queries.


Things I should improve on the next projects:
 * learn more about BEM or similar methodology, stop styling elements by html tag, use class always!;
 * I should use one convencion with media queries, e.g. if i use @mixin named 'description' I should prepare all styling
 inside this @mixin;
 * I should prepare photos for different devices, but in this case it is not so 'heavy';
 * learn more about owl-carousel - beatifull plugin;
 * javascript...;
